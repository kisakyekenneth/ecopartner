                          ISO 45001:2018 is an International Standard that
                          specifies requirements for an occupational health and
                          safety (OH&S) management system. It sets the minimum
                          standard of practice to protect employees in any
                          organization worldwide. It is set to transform
                          workplace practices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Whether it’s a failure to protect workers against
                          toxic chemicals, or a sleep-deprived employee getting
                          into a fatal car accident, millions of people are hurt
                          at work every year. Now, with the arrival of the
                          world’s first International Standard on occupational
                          health and safety, many such incidents can be
                          prevented. Uncover why ISO 45001 has the potential to
                          be a real game changer for millions of workers (and
                          workplace health hazards) around the world.

                          Benefits of implementing ISO 45001:2015 in an
                          organization Internationally recognized ISO 45001 puts

                          acceptance by regulators, the public, and interested
                          parties. Accepted as being proactive about Health and
                          Safety and continual improvement. Improves business
                          performance. ISO 45001 health/safety management system
                          reduces workplace illness and injury and increase
                          productivity. Creates consistency throughout the
                          organization built around “best practices”. Provides a
                          platform for attracting lower insurance premiums
                          Allows better identification of hazards and risk and
                          later develops plans to manage them. Improves the
                          efficiency of internal operations, reduces accidents,

                          mode.

                          The benefits to Implementing ISO 45001 are endless and
                          when implemented correctly it provides the company
                          with an effective tool that will show return on
                          investment. ISO 45001 has been written to apply even
                          to small businesses, regardless of size, type. It can
                          easily be integrated with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001
                          because the Annex SL structure is the same for all ISO
                          standards. Other aspects of worker health and safety
                          can be integrated such as wellbeing and may be
                          required by local/state legal requirements. The ISO
                          45001 standard does not specifically address issues
                          such as product safety, property damage or
                          environmental and social impact. The standard’s
                          primary goal is to eliminate or minimize the risk of
                          harm to people.

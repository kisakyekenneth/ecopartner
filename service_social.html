                        <p>
                          Socio-economic survey tools are designed to collect
                          information as a means of improving understanding of
                          local resource management systems, resource use and
                          the relative importance of resources for households
                          and villages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Eco & Partner carries out community surveys relevant
                          to the socio-economic baseline as part of the wider
                          social assessment. These surveys cover population,
                          gender analysis, demographics, households, economy and
                          livelihoods, land and property, land use, social
                          infrastructure and services, community safety,
                          security, and welfare, occupational health and safety,
                          health and educational conditions, cultural aspects,
                          and other local social aspects, so that the local
                          socio-economic characteristics can be assessed. The
                          planning of the survey samples takes into
                          consideration the need for equal representation from
                          male and female respondents, including those who may
                          be marginalized due to their ethnicity, national
                          origin, age, occupation, religious affiliation, among
                          others. The planning of the surveys always considers
                          community resources accessed by both male and female
                          household members.

                        <p>
                          We help our clients carry out socio-economic survey
                          and census of affected persons and households. Our
                          approach is in bench-marked on the IFC and World Bank
                          ESS 5 standards to determine the socio-economic
                          baseline conditions of the Project affected people
                          prior to project establishment. Through our network of
                          social experts with diverse language skills, we are
                          able to integrate and streamline a broad set of
                          offerings, providing our clients with efficiencies and
                          strategic approaches.

                        <p>
                          Socio-economic survey tools provide a means of
                          improving understanding of local resource management
                          systems, resource use and the relative importance of
                          resources for households and villages. They can also
                          be used to elicit insights on interaction with
                          government decision-making systems, community
                          perceptions of trends and priority issues, and
                          community-based institutions and their role in the
                          sustainable use and conservation of natural resources.
                          Use of such tools is an important first step in
                          engaging local communities and ensuring that local
                          voices are heard and that the community relationship
                          with resources, land rights and access are
                          incorporated into the project design.

                        <p>
                          We design surveys, train in conducting the surveys and

                          socio-economic surveys of households and villages. We
                          use an integrated approach employing both quantitative
                          and qualitative methods. We undertake household
                          surveys, key informant interviews, focus group
                          discussions including community mapping. We also
                          deploy powerful mobile data collection tools such as
                          Survey CTO and ODK.

                          socioeconomic data through application advanced
                          analytics to understand key trends, diagnose the root
                          cause, identify correlations and hence derive
                          effective insights from the data. We have a competent

                        <p>
                          We use a combination of tools to build dynamic visuals
                          to help tell the data story effectively for
                          stakeholders and different audiences. We use
                          infographics and digital presentations to engage with
                          regulators and community stakeholders more
                          effectively. This helps to safeguard and strengthen
                          stakeholder relations.

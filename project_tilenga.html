                          Tilenga: located in the Buliisa and Nwoya districts in
                          the Lake Albert, the Tilenga project is operated by
                          Total Energies (56.6%), in partnership with CNOOC and
                          UNOC. It includes the development of six fields and
                          the drilling of around 400 wells from 31 locations.
                          Production will be delivered through buried pipelines
                          to a treatment plant built in Kasenyi, for the
                          separation and treatment of the fluids (oil, water,
                          gas. All of the water produced will be reinjected into
                          the fields and the gas will be used to produce the
                          energy needed for the treatment process. Surplus
                          electricity will be exported to the pipeline and the
                          Ugandan grid.

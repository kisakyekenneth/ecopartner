                        <p>
                          At Eco & Partner Consult, we understand that an Impact
                          Assessment is much more than just a technical
                          document. It leads to the development of often legally
                          binding commitments based on and enshrined in the
                          management plan. These are living documents that
                          develop over the life of the project and often
                          independently monitored. In this way, it is a
                          developer’s technical environmental and social
                          assessment of a project and key element of corporate
                          social responsibility ultimately, of a company’s
                          license to operate.

                    <p>
                      Eco & Partner Consult Ltd is currently developing an
                      Integrated Management System (IMS) with an intension of
                      achieving ISO certification. The IMS certification
                      involves the implementation of three ISO standards: ISO
                      9001 for quality management, ISO 14001 for environmental
                      management, and ISO 45001 for occupational health and
                      safety management. The certification process is intended
                      to evaluate our organization’s ability to effectively
                      manage our operations while meeting these standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As an environmental, social, and sustainability firm, we
                      have robust systems and processes in place to ensure we
                      meet our clients’ needs while adhering to strict
                      environmental, social, and safety standards. However,
                      achieving IMS certification reiterates our commitment to
                      continuous improvement and stakeholder engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The ISO 9001 standard focuses on quality management. Eco &
                      Partner has developed, implemented and achieved
                      certification of its Quality Management System. This
                      management system has been in place since October 2017,
                      with the intention of meeting the needs of our clients and
                      stakeholders. Through the implementation of the ISO 9001
                      standard, we are ensuring that our services meet the
                      highest standards of quality and we are continuously
                      improving to better serve our clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The ISO 14001 and 4500 standards are focused on
                      environmental management and health & safety respectively.
                      Eco and Partner has had a Health Safety and Environment
                      management system in place since its founding in 2003,
                      comprising of our policy commitment, plans to achieve our
                      policy objects and means of evaluation of our performance
                      against the set objectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We are currently undertaking a process to develop a single
                      system (Integrated Management System) designed to manage
                      these multiple aspects of our operations in line with
                      these multiple standards. In order to avoid duplicating
                      processes or creating unnecessary extra work for our
                      staff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Ultimately, safety, environmental management and quality
                      control have many common points, and all work towards the
                      goal of making our organization more effective and
                      efficient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In summary, we aim to meet the highest standards of
                      management and contribute to the sustainability of the
                      planet. IMS certification is a significant achievement
                      that reinforces our commitment to our clients,
                      stakeholders, and the environment.
